# Data-Analysis

Programs written involve processing given data (categorical and numerical) with python. Central tendency measures are used when comparing a number of datasets, especially in case of performing analysis on the movie datasets.

The program fea_eng.py uses feature engineering to transform raw imdb dataset into cohesive features that better represent the underlying problems to the predictive model, resulting in improved model accuracy onthe rather large, unseen data.

graph.py involves performing exploratory data analysis to extract and refine the Pokemon dataset (contains categorical columns and numerical) before presenting it in a variety of different graphs (histogram, boxplot, scatterplot, line graph) to visually gauge the data distribution. A kernel density estimate (KDE) plot was used to initially visualize the distribution of observations in the dataset, analagous to a histogram since it represented the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions.
